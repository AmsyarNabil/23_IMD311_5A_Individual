<p>
On my experience, I don't have much experience in the field of work that allows me to be an experience person
<br>
<br>
in work. I have worked with the Petronas company after finishing school as a salesman at a gas station for 5  
<br>
<br>
months before i accepted the offer to continue my studies at the diploma level. As long as i work i can learn 
<br>
<br>
the meaning of being tired in finding money to survive in a life full of challenges. Other than that, My experience
<br>
<br>
in studying at the Diploma level taught me many things that allowed me to be proficient in various ways. Outreach 
<br>
<br>
program is the best experience in my life because i can learn to work in groups and learn to manage programs succesfully.
<br>
<br>
In the program implemented at Rumah Penyayang Darul Ilmi, Gombak, Selangor by me and my group members, We taught children 
<br>
<br>
and adults about computer technology and gave some help with tools, food, and also some money to cover the cost of financing
<br>
<br>
poor chidren there.
